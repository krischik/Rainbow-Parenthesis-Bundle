=== slve improvements ===

My technique only worked up to 16 level. Which is isn't any good for languages
like lisp. slve fixed this with a recursive solution. Very need.

=== autre improvements ===

This fork provides for a small fix to the plugin. It also customises the parenthesis colours for a dark background.

=== charlietanksley improvements ===

Fork of original. Forked primarily to remove the background colour on the syntax highlighting.

=== krischik improvements ===

* Fixed all the bugs and merged all the code.
* Vim got a little stricter on syntax highlights and some of slve tricks didn't work any more. I also added an option to choose between my colour set and those of the other contributors.
* Increased the levels before repeating back to 16. Slve repeated after 10.
* Switched the background colours around for better contrast between level 15 and level 0.
